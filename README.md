- gen_linear: original generator problem
- gen_linear_mod2: modify generator durative action as process. 
- gen_linear_mod3: modify generator problem to delay the availability of tanks, and ensure that generator starts running at beginning.
- gen_linear_mod4: second experiment described in paper. modified generator problem where task is to full generator to defined fuel level, with scheduled leaks.
- gen_linear_mod5: additional experiment, where there are multiple generators, but only one tank.
