- gen_linear: original generator problem.
- gen_linear_mod3: experiment 2 described in paper: modifies original generator problem to delay the availability of tanks, and ensure that generator starts running at beginning.
- gen_linear_mod4: experiment 3 described in paper: modified generator problem where task is to full generator to defined fuel level, with scheduled leaks.
- gen_linear_mod5: additional experiment, where there are multiple generators, but only one tank.
